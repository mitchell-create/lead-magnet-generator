# Answers to Your Questions

## Question 1: Can we pull company lists (no emails) from Apollo or Prospeo without paying?

### ✅ **Apollo: YES (with caveats)**

**What you get:**
- Company name, website, description, industry
- Keyword filtering support ✅
- Uses fewer credits (company-only exports)

**Cost:**
- Free plan: Limited credits (~50-100 companies/month)
- Paid plan: $49/month (unlimited company searches, limited exports)

**Recommendation:** Apollo is good if you need keyword filtering and can use the free tier.

### ✅ **Prospeo: YES (already free for you!)**

**What you get:**
- Person data + company data (name, domain, description)
- No emails/phones in search results ✅
- Your paid plan covers this

**Cost:**
- Company search: $0 (your plan covers it)
- Email enrichment: $0.75 for 50 emails (when you need them)

**Recommendation:** Prospeo is best since you already have it and it's essentially free!

**Note:** Prospeo returns persons, but you can extract unique companies from the results.

## Question 2: Can we use Apify to pull company lists?

### ✅ **Apify: YES**

**What you can do:**
- Scrape company directories (Google Maps, industry sites)
- Pull LinkedIn public company pages
- Custom scrapers for any public source

**Cost:**
- Free tier: $5 credits/month (~100-500 companies)
- Paid: $29/month for more capacity

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Legal/ToS: Must respect robots.txt and rate limits
- ⚠️ Some sites block scrapers (may need proxies)
- ⚠️ Data quality varies (requires cleanup)

**Recommendation:** Apify is a good supplement if you need bulk data from public sources.

## My Recommendation 🎯

**Use Prospeo (you already have it!):**

1. ✅ Pull company data for FREE (no emails)
2. ✅ AI qualify companies
3. ✅ Save to Supabase
4. ✅ Later enrich 50 qualified companies ($0.75 total)

**Total cost: $0.75 for 50 emails** - essentially free!
